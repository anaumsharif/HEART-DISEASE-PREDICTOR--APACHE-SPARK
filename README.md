# HEART DISEASE PREDICTOR 
Critical capabilities of Apache Spark is the machine learning abilities available in the Spark MLlib. 
The Apache Spark MLlib provides an out-of-the-box solution for doing classification and regression, collaborative filtering, clustering, distributed linear algebra, decision trees, random forests, gradient-boosted trees, frequent pattern mining, evaluation metrics, and statistics. 
The capabilities of the MLlib, combined with the various data types Spark can handle, make Apache Spark an indispensable Big Data tool.
This model is highly efficient in identifying patients at risk of heart disease.
Many factors, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and abnormal pulse rate, need to be considered when predicting heart disease 
Often, the medical data available need to be completed, affecting the results in predicting heart disease. Machine learning plays a crucial role in the medical field.
